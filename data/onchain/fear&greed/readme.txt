The index is calculated by Alternate.me using a range of sources: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media, dominance, and trends. Surveys have also been used in the past, but are currently paused. Also, the signals are based on bitcoin

Volatility - A rise in volatility is used as a sign of a fearful market.
Market momentum/volume - The current market momentum is compared to the current volume. When buying volumes are outpacing the longer term momentum, it signals the market is getting too greedy. 
Social media - Using a Twitter sentiment analysis tool, an unusually high interaction rate is used to identify greedy market behaviour. 
Dominance - A rise in bitcoin dominance is considered a sign of a fearful market moving to a safer asset, while a fall in bitcoin dominance is seen as a sign the market is getting too greedy and moving to more speculative altcoins. 
Trends - Data from Google Trends is used to see how many people are searching for information about bitcoin. An increase in certain search terms such as ‘bitcoin price manipulation’ is considered a fearful signal, while ‘bitcoin price prediction’ would be considered more bullish.
